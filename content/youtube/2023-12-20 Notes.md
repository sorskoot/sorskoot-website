Hello coders! ðŸ‘¾

In the latest development stream for our Christmas Horror VR game, we made significant progress on an intricate puzzle that will be a key feature in the game. I've gone for a Christmas theme around the studio, and I've also been tweaking the lighting and green screen setup to enhance the stream quality.

Puzzle Development
The main focus of this stream was to continue enhancing a puzzle we worked on in the previous stream. We've been fine-tuning the position of the in-game ornaments and integrating them into a challenging puzzle for the player. The goal is to rotate and align various objects to match hints given by a Christmas tree.

Christmas Tree as a Clue
The Christmas tree in the game initially appears white. As the player progresses, certain ornaments on the tree will change to red, signaling it's time for the puzzle. These red ornaments then serve as clues for the players to solve the puzzle.

Detaching and Aligning Ornaments
To prepare for this feature, I detached several ornaments from the Christmas tree and gave them separate meshes so we could add different materials. These materials will be dynamic and change color during gameplay. By placing and rotating these ornaments correctly, the player will progress through the puzzle.

Implementation Challenges
During the stream, there were some challenges with selecting and detaching the ornaments due to how they were grouped. After some tweaking and using Blenderâ€™s features like the pivot point adjustments and the local axis for precise rotation, I was able to align the objects as needed for the puzzle.

Wonderland Engine Update
After the modifications in Blender, we exported the models and updated them in the Wonderland Engine. The update process was a bit cumbersome, as we encountered some issues with missing meshes, but we managed to resolve these by re-importing the objects. We then went through the process of correctly attaching the ornaments to the meshes and ensuring the materials were set up to enable the color change during gameplay.

Testing in VR
Finally, we tested the puzzle in VR to ensure that the drawer mechanics worked and that the tree hinted at the player correctly. We also made sure that the other ornaments remained visible when not in use for the puzzle.

Next Steps
Moving forward, we will work on adding the next stages of the game, integrating sound effects, and further developing the puzzles. We have a story document to guide us through the narrative, which will be essential in creating an immersive and cohesive experience.

Thank you all for joining the stream and engaging with the development process. Your support and feedback are incredibly valuable. Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting Christmas Horror VR game, and I'll catch you in the next stream!
