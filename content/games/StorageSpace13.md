# Back To Space

## Story
You are a janitor on a freight spaceship, Storage Space 13. After flying through a meteor shower, the ship is a mess. Boxes are all over the place and vents are leaking. You need to clean up the mess of boxes and place them onto the leaking vents on the floor. The gravity system of the ship is a bit broken and is only working on your boots. This means the boxes can only slide forward and only stop when hitting a wall or another box. You need to get close to push them.
