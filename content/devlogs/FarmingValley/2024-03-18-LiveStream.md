Hello Coders! ðŸ‘¾

In our latest live stream, we made significant progress on "Farming Valley," the cozy VR game I am building with the Wonderland Engine. We are shaping the world generation and experimenting with tile selection for a more interactive experience. Let's dive into the details!

## Stream Recap

Last week, we got the project off the ground, and this session brought a mix of troubleshooting and new feature implementation. We decided against using HDRIs from the nightly version of the Wonderland Engine for now to avoid complications with our day-night cycle implementation.

### Shader Challenges

We faced challenges with the 16x16 texturesâ€”upscaled to 64x64 for better clarity. However, with larger textures, mipmap generation in Wonderland Engine didn't work as expected, leading to pixelated visuals from a distance. We're leaving this as is for the moment and may add a green fog as a temporary visual fix.

### Library Additions

During the stream, we added several libraries to our project:
- My own component library, which is open-source and hopefully compatible with the latest engine versions.
- RxJS for reactive programming, crucial for tracking in-game state changes.
- TweenJS for smooth animations and transitions.

These additions pave the way for robust state management and better player interaction feedback in our game.

### Tile Selection and World Generation

The main focus was on world generation using two specific textures to switch between when clicking a tile. We aim for a dynamic tile switching mechanism that lays the foundation for gameplay interactions like planting and harvesting. 

By adding a cursor object to the right controller and using raycasting, we managed to project a blue marker onto the ground tiles, providing visual feedback on tile selection. This sets the stage for future features like object interaction and teleportation within the game world.

### Development Philosophy

As the stream progressed, we discussed the importance of using TypeScript for larger game projects due to its robustness in handling complex codebases. I also shared my experiences with converting JavaScript code to TypeScript, which revealed subtle bugs and ultimately resulted in more stable gameplay.

### Community and Learning

I mentioned my game development course, which is nearing completion, and the plans to deploy a game on itch.io as part of the curriculum. This educational journey will soon earn me an official certification as a game developer.

## Conclusion

In this session, we experimented with different aspects of our cozy VR game, from visual elements to interactive functionality. We're building a strong foundation for "Farming Valley" that players will be able to enjoy in a fully immersive VR environment. Stay tuned for more updates, and don't forget to subscribe to the channel for future streams!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
