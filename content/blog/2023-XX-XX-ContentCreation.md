# My Ultimate List of WebXR Game Development Tools üõ†Ô∏è

Hello Coders! üéÆ As a WebXR game developer, I'm always experimenting with different tools and software to improve my workflow and bring my ideas to life. I've received numerous questions about the software I use, so I thought it's time to share my ultimate list of WebXR game development tools with you all! Keep in mind a lot of tools are not free, but definitely worth it.

## Game Engines üéÆ

Let's start with the engines that power my games:

- **[Wonderland Engine](https://wonderlandengine.com/)**: A great engine specifically designed for WebXR experiences and my preferred way to build WebXR.
- **[Unity](https://unity3d.com/)**: The industry-standard engine that needs no introduction.
- **[A-Frame](https://aframe.io/)**: An open-source web framework for creating virtual reality experiences. This is a great framework to get started with WebXR. It's actually what I used for my first games.
- **[PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com/)**: A powerful cloud-based game engine with an intuitive editor.
- **[Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/)**: Another fantastic open-source engine for building 3D games and experiences.

## Coding üíª

My go-to code editors and IDEs for writing all those lines of code:

- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**: A lightweight yet feature-rich code editor that I use daily. I use this for all my JavaScript, Python and pretty much everything that is not C#.
- **[Visual Studio Enterprise](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/enterprise/)**: A powerful IDE for when I need more advanced debugging and profiling tools. This is what I use to code C#. Web, Azure functions or console apps, I use it a lot. I've been using it for many years and often need the enterprise functionality like live testing and the diagnostics. I use it with [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) to customize it as much as possible.
- **[Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)**: A cross-platform .NET IDE that can be quite handy at times. I've used this a lot for working with Unity. If you can't afford VS Enterprise this is a great choice.

## Code Libraries üìö

Some useful libraries that save me a ton of time:

- **[RxJs](https://rxjs.dev/)**: A library for reactive programming using Observables, perfect for handling asynchronous events.
- **[wle_pp](https://github.com/SignorPipo/wle_pp)**: My favorite collection of utility functions for Wonderland Engine.
- **[Sorskoot Wonderland Components](https://github.com/sorskoot/SorskootWonderlandComponents)**: Of course I also use my own stuff.

## Modelling üé®

Creating all those 3D models and assets for my games:

- **[Blender](https://www.blender.org/)**: The open-source 3D creation suite that has become an industry staple.
- **[Asset Forge](https://kenney.itch.io/assetforge)**: A fantastic tool for quickly creating 3D models by combining pre-made blocks.
- **[Kenney Shape](https://kenney.nl/tools/kenney-shape?kenney-shape/)**: A simple yet powerful tool for making basic low-poly models.

## Texturing / Graphics üñåÔ∏è

Making my games look pretty with these amazing graphic tools:

- **[Substance Designer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2200010/Substance_3D_Designer_2023/)**: The industry standard for creating custom materials and textures.
- **[Pyxel Edit](https://www.pyxeledit.com/)**: A pixel art editor perfect for creating retro-style sprites.
- **[SpriteMancer](https://spritemancer.com/)**: A procedural sprite generator that creates unique animations quickly.
- **[Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)**: The classic image editing software we all know and love.
- **[Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/)**: A vector graphics editor that is an excellent alternative to Adobe Illustrator.
- **[TextCraft](https://textcraft.net/)**: An online text generator for creating stylish game logos and titles.
- **[MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/)**: An incredible voxel art editor with a very user-friendly interface.

## Music üéµ

At the moment I'm fully switched to **[FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio/)**. I've been wanting to for a long time, but could never afford it. Thanks to the Zesty ads (link below) I was able to buy it.

In the past I mainly used:

- **[Renoise](https://www.renoise.com/)**: A powerful digital audio workstation based on the heritage of tracker software.
- **[Propellerheads Reason](https://reasonstudios.com/)**: Another excellent DAW with a vast array of built-in instruments and effects.

## Other üåü

Some other resources that deserve a mention:

- **[Zesty](https://zesty.market/)**: I don't mind showing ads in my games. Zesty offers ads tailored to an immersive experience. 
- **[Fesliyan Studios](https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/)**: An amazing resource for royalty-free music tracks and sound effects.
- **[Humble Bundles](https://www.humblebundle.com/?partner=sorskoot)**: Keep an eye out for their game development bundles‚Äîthey often have incredible deals! (And I'm a partner, so if you by something you'll support the blogs! :) )
- **[ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/)**: An awesome platform where you can find inspiration from other artists and even purchase assets for your projects.
- **[Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/publisher-sale)**: You are allowed to use the assets from the Unity assetstore in other projectes as well. They give away a free asset every week.
- **[Unreal Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/assets?count=20&sortBy=effectiveDate&sortDir=DESC&start=0&tag=4910)**: Unreal assets can also be used outside of Unreal. You need to export them from the editor, but the free monthly assets are worth it. I have used paid assets in my games as well (Santa's workshop for example).


## Wrap-up

And there you have it! This is my ultimate list of tools and resources that help me create amazing WebXR games. Remember, it's not the tools themselves that make great games‚Äîit's how you use them. So go forth, experiment, and create some awesome WebXR experiences!

Happy Coding! üöÄ
