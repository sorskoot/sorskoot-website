During the Covid-19 crisis all over the world, we noticed a lot of people from all over the world joining our meetups and members of our community hanging out in other meetups. We decided to try and bring everyone together in one [Discord server]( http://discord.gg/Jt5tfaM). Here we can share links to our events and recordings, but also help each other out with issues when developing with A-frame, Babylon.js, or Unity and running your apps on devices like the Oculus Quest or Microsoft Hololens. Now we need **you** to join and help grow this community to become the official WebXR community.

Make sure to share the invite with your friends and colleagues: [WebXR Discord,  http://discord.gg/Jt5tfaM]( http://discord.gg/Jt5tfaM)!
