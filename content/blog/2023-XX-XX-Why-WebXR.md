blogpost on why I choose WebXR over native
Title suggestion: Why I choose WebXR over Native.
Outline:
- First. I like it. I like working with web tech and JavaScript or TypeScript. Just like one likes camping and some else likes to stay in a hotel. Why? just because.
- Easy distribution, no app stores. So also very easy to update and distribute
- Open. Like the web is. Discoverablity is included and links to your app or game are very easy to be shared. I believe WebXR is the start of the actual MetaVerse. 
- Runs on pretty much every platform. Without the need to recompile. 
- Develop-Debug cycle is VERY short.
- Capability based. When new devices are released WebXR just works as long as they support the spec. So you don't need to build a new app for every new device.

# Why I Choose WebXR Over Native

Hello Coders! ðŸ‘¾ When it comes to developing immersive experiences, there are plenty of choices out there. But for me, there's only one clear winner: WebXR. There's something about WebXR that just speaks to my soul. In a world where a lot of people would opt for native app development, I choose WebXR for all my virtual and augmented reality projects. And today, I'm going to share with you all the reasons why I, personally, choose WebXR over native.

## The Heart Wants What It Wants

There's no denying it â€“ I love working with web technology and JavaScript (or TypeScript). It's like choosing between camping and staying in a hotel. Some people prefer the rugged outdoors, while others like the comfort of a cozy room. Me? I'll take web tech any day.

Why? Well, there's just something about it that excites me. The possibilities are endless, and the creative potential is off the charts. Plus, it's familiar territory for me â€“ I've spent countless hours tinkering away with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so it feels like home.

## No App Stores, No Problem

One thing that irks me about native development is the reliance on app stores. Sure, they're convenient for users, but they can be a real pain for developers. With WebXR, you don't have to worry about app stores or their approval processes â€“ your content is easily accessible through a web browser.

This also means that updating your app or game is a breeze. No need to wait for app store approval or force users to download updates manually; just push your changes live and watch as everyone enjoys your latest masterpiece.

## An Open World

The web is open by nature â€“ it's one of its defining characteristics. And this openness extends to WebXR as well. With native apps, discoverability can be a challenge; you're often limited to app stores and their algorithms.

But with WebXR, discoverability is baked right in. Anyone can stumble upon your masterpiece by following a link shared by a friend or posted on social media. There are no barriers â€“ just an open world waiting to be explored.

And speaking of sharing links, that's another thing I love about WebXR â€“ how easy it is to spread the word about your creations. With just a simple URL, anyone can dive into your virtual world without any hassle.

In my eyes, WebXR is the true starting point of the metaverse â€“ an interconnected network of immersive experiences just waiting to be discovered.

## One Platform to Rule Them All

Another major selling point for me when it comes to WebXR is its incredible compatibility across platforms. Instead of having to recompile your app for different devices or operating systems, you can rest easy knowing that your content will run smoothly on pretty much any device with a web browser.

This not only saves time and energy but also ensures that your creation reaches as wide an audience as possible.

Apple was the only one behind in this, but with the latest on the new Vision Pro Apple has announced it will support WebXR in Safari as well. 

## Lightning Fast Development

Anyone who's ever developed an app or game knows that the develop-debug cycle can be a real slog. But with WebXR, this process is much more streamlined and efficient.

Since you're working with web technologies like JavaScript (or TypeScript), you can take advantage of browser-based developer tools and quickly iterate on your product without having to wait for lengthy recompilations or restarts.

This rapid feedback loop ultimately leads to better experiences for users because you can quickly squash bugs and refine features before they even have a chance to become problematic.

## Future-Proofing Your Creations

WebXR is designed with future devices in mind. As long as a new device supports the WebXR specification, your content will work seamlessly without any additional effort on your part.

This means you won't have to scramble every time there's a new piece of hardware released; instead, you can sit back and enjoy the fact that your work is already mostly compatible with whatever new gadgets hit the market.

Plus, this capability-based approach also ensures that older devices aren't left out in the cold; they'll still be able to enjoy your immersive experiences even if they don't boast cutting-edge specs.

## Wrapping It Up

So there you have it â€“ the main reasons why I choose WebXR over native development when creating immersive experiences. From its compatibility across platforms to its short develop-debug cycles and everything in between, WebXR offers unparalleled advantages that simply can't be ignored.

I hope this blog post has given you some insight into why I'm such a fan of this powerful technology - and maybe even inspired you to give it a try yourself! Trust me; once you dive into the world of WebXR, there's no turning back!

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
