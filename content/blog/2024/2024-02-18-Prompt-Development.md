Hello Coders! ðŸ‘¾ 

Remember when I mentioned [Rosie and how much it relies on Semantic Kernel](/blog/2024/2024-02-13-rosie-and-semantic-kernel/)? Well, I've been diving deeper into this world and guess what? I stumbled upon a fantastic tool that's been a game-changer for me â€“ the Semantic Kernel VS Code extension. A great tool for testing and debugging prompts used within SK.

## Setting Up the Workspace

First things first, getting the Semantic Kernel extension up and running in Visual Studio Code was easy. I just had to pop open the Extensions view (you know, that little square icon on the sidebar), type in "Semantic Kernel Tools", and hit install. VoilÃ ! I was ready to roll. You can also find the [Semantic Kernel extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-semantic-kernel.semantic-kernel) online if you prefer.

## Crafting and Refining Prompts

Creating and editing prompts is now a piece of cake. The extension adds a panel to the interface where I can manage all prompts. I can write new ones from scratch, generate them from a description or tweak existing ones until they're just right. And the best part? I can test them on the spot. No more switching back and forth, and copying and pasting, to and from the online playground â€“ it's all right there in VS Code.

## Testing Prompts Like a Pro

Testing prompts is super important, right? We want to make sure our AI buddy understands us correctly. So, here's how I do it with the extension:

1. I make sure the extension is connected to my Azure account. With that set up all my AI endpoints show up. 
2. Then, I head over to the Semantic Kernel functions view, pick a prompt, or add a new one.
3. With a simple click on "Run Function," I can see the AI's response in the Output view.

## The Results Are In!

After tweaking and testing, I finally get the output I'm looking for. It's incredibly satisfying to see the AI respond just the way I intended. And if it doesn't? Well, back to the drawing board, but with the extension, it's more fun than frustrating. Crafting good prompts might take a lot of iterating. This extension makes it as easy as possible.

## Wrapping Up

I've got to say, the Semantic Kernel VS Code extension has been a revelation. It's streamlined my workflow, made prompt management a joy, and saved me a ton of time. If you're working with LLMs, I can't recommend it enough.

So, what do you think? Are you as excited about this extension as I am? Have you tried it out yet? Drop your thoughts and experiences in the comments â€“ I'd love to hear from you!
