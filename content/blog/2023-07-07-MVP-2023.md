## My 13th Microsoft MVP Award 

Hello Coders! ðŸ‘¾ I'm absolutely thrilled to announce that I've just bagged my 13th Microsoft MVP award. Yes, you read it right - 13th! It's a moment of profound pride and joy for me, and I'm swimming in gratitude.

## So, What's a Microsoft MVP? ðŸ¤”

In case you're scratching your head, wondering what a Microsoft MVP is, let me enlighten you. It's a prestigious honor Microsoft give dedicated people who love to share their knowledge and experience in technology. These people are special kind of tech-nuts. It's a recognition of our constant dedication to the community. Since the last year was rough for me professionally as well as personally, you can probably grasp how ecstatic I was when I received the notification congratulating me with the MVP award for the 13th time!

## The Perks of Being an MVP 

One of the most exciting perks of being an MVP (besides software licenses and Azure credits) is the invaluable chance to engage in conversations and exclusive sessions with the Mixed Reality team at Microsoft. Alas, this stuff is under NDA (non-disclosure agreement), so my lips are zipped about the specifics. But here's what I can reveal - these sessions offer a unique platform to pose questions and provide feedback directly to the folks working on MR and HoloLens. It feels fantastic to contribute to these ground-breaking dialogues.

## My Future Endeavors

So, what am I up to next as a Microsoft MVP? This coming year, I'll be sinking my teeth even deeper into WebXR and TypeScript for sure. Because I keep access to Microsoft Azure I can learn more about AI and how to use that. I'll also be drafting tutorials, whipping up blog posts, recording, and streaming videos. My mission remains the same - making coding WebXR more approachable and fun-filled for everyone.

## Stay Tuned for More! 

I have some thrilling news that I'm dying to share with you all, but you'll have to keep your patience for now. 

Here's raising a toast to another year of coding, learning, and sharing! Thank you for embarking on this journey with me. 

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
