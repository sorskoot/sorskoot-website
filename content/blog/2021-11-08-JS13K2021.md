## INTRO
13KB. In perspective, there could go at least 113 of these games on 1, 3.5” HD Floppy disk.
And yet. 223 people managed to build it for this year’s JS13K game jam in 5 categories.
I participated in the WebXR category again. And managed to build a VR puzzle game in 13KB.
This is the post mortem of ‘Storage Space 13’

## CHAPTER 1: WHAT IS JS13K
In the JS13K game jam it’s the challenge to build a game that you can squeeze in a 13KB zipfile. No external frameworks and all game assets have to fit in that zip.
Except for the WebXR category. Only in this category it is allowed to use an external framework that is specified by the jam. You could use A-Frame, Three.js and Babylon. Added to the list this year was PlayCanvas. I’ve used PlayCanvas in other jams in the past, but this time you could not use the Editor. By using the editor you won’t have enough control over the size of the game. But you could use the PlayCanvas engine and build the entire game in code.

JS13K comes with a theme each year. This year the theme was Space. 

## CHAPTER 2: IDEA FOR MY GAME
This first thing that came to my mind as an idea for a game was to build a Space Invaders clone. Unfortunately I built that 2 years ago for JS13K and the game is still doing pretty well on Construct Arcade. 

For a long time I wanted to do a non-Euclidian game. A game with invisible portals. Whenever you pass through a portal you end up in a different illogical place of the ship. The idea was that your spaceship had passed though a black hole. That messed up the ship. Since you work as janitor on that ship you have to push all the boxes back to the right spots. Unfortunately this required the use of stencil buffers and for some reason this didn’t work on the Quest. I event tried different frameworks. But non worked, so I had to drop the portal and non-Euclidian ideas.

The only things that stuck from that idea where the moving of boxes and a spaceship. Eventually I settled with a game inspired by a classic arcade game. I decided to go with a Sokoban clone. I only changed the mechanic of moving boxes a bit. Instead of pushing them forward 1 meter at a time, the boxes slide forward until they hit either a wall or another box. The goal is to place all the boxes on specific targets.     

## CHAPTER 3: PLAYCANVAS
In the past I build a few games with PlayCanvas. One of them is still available on Itch.io (and will be on Construct Arcade as well soon). The difference with that game is that this time I have to comply to the 13KB limit. The jam organizers provided a link to the ‘engine only’ version of PlayCanvas. This meant everything has to be done from code. Luckily JavaScript is the same no matter what framework you use so I was able to reuse some ideas from previous years. Even the shaders I’ve been developing through the multiple jams could be reused. 

The main thing you have to do when building a game with PlayCanvas is creating scripts you can attach to components. Kinda similar to how MonoBehaviors are used in Unity and how components are attached to objects in A-Frame. 

One of the biggest challenge with using PlayCanvas was figuring out how to get everything loaded in order. I really wanted separate everything in different files. But, the ‘app’-object had to be created first. Because the components need to be registered with the app. If I used the normal concatenate-everything-together method the order would be wrong and the app won’t work. The solution was to start the root piece of code with creating the app and then, asynchronously, loading the rest of the files using `await import(‘some-file’);`

Another challenge was to get everything to work together. Most of the documentation focusses on the online editor and only parts of the API documentation show some sample on how to do things on code. On the forum people have asked a lot of questions and some are answered with examples. That helped a lot to figure things out. For the rest, it was just setting breakpoints in the code and figuring things out by trying different things. 

## CHAPTER 4: THE GAME

### Graphics

For graphics I mananged to reuse the shaders I've been using for the last couple of years now. These basically boil down to reading a sprite from the texture atlas and drawing it. The texture atlas is a bit of a challenge to get right. I used PyxelEdit to create the texture atlas. I used a 16x16 grid to keep everything as small as possible. This time I choose a palette upfront. I got one that I liked from [Lospec](https://lospec.com/palette-list/matt36) called Matt36. I tried a few palettes with fewer colors but I couldn't make it work. 

There are animations in the textures as well. This is a little trick I build into the shaders. Some tiles are marked special in the game. In these tiles the gray values are used as an index into a different atlas. This atlas is basically a list of colors. 
 {{< img-link "/images/2021/11/JS13K_colors.png" "Colors" >}}. The colors are shifted over time creating an animation.

Just after the competition I got some feedback about the performance being not very good. At that point I checked using Spector.js and it turned out the game created 2 draw calls per cube rendered on the screen, resulting in something like 80 draw calls.
