During the Halloween Scream Stream this year I wanted to modify the color of the camera. A great and easy way of doing this is to create a color LUT, or Lookup Table and apply this to your camera. In this tutorial I show you how you can create one using Adobe Photoshop and apply it to your camera in OBS.

<!--  Intro -->

## Creating a LUT

Create a default image
And modify this in Photoshop

## Converting the LUT to an image

Convert the LUT to an image

## Applying the LUT

Add the filter to your Camera in OBS
