I posted this to the WebXR discord (https://discord.gg/Jt5tfaM), but I thought it might be helpful to anyone interested outside of the Discord as well (but you should join ðŸ˜‰).

This week is the [Global XR Conference](https://globalxrconference.com/) (Dec 1 - 3) and there are a couple of WebXR related talks and workshops.
