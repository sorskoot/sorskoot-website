# Devlog Day 8: Life at Pixel Farm 
## Fine-tune & Polish ‚ú®

Hello fellow devs! üå± Today, I'll share my progress on Day 8 of developing a casual VR farming game for the [GameDev&#x2024;tv Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevtv-jam-2023). The game is built with Unity and has a 2D aesthetic despite being in VR to follow the theme of the jam, "Life in 2 dimensions". There's just one problem - I miscalculated the duration of the jam! I initially thought it was running for 10 days, but the first day was only a few hours because it started in the evening. So, my planning was one day off. Fortunately, I had the main game loop done already, but I might not be able to implement all features I had planned. We'll see.

## Beautifying the World üå≥

I worked a lot on making the world look better today. The farming areas have been expanded from 3 to 9, and I added teleportation places for each area. To make teleportation easier, I also added a path between them. A farmhouse is now present, surrounded by more trees to give it that cozy farm feel. Oh, and let's not forget the rooster's morning call ‚Äì my daughter suggested that! üêì

## Watering and Harvesting Animations üí¶

I created an animation for when you water the plants using [SpriteMancer](https://spritemancer.com/) to create a particle effect and rendered that as a pixel art animation to fit the game's aesthetic. I also added an animation for when you harvest the crops. For both animations, I created a small script that automatically destroys a game object when an animation is complete ‚Äì pretty handy!

## Tool Selection Improvements üîß

I tweaked how tools are shown in your right hand so it's more visible which tool is selected. This should help make gameplay smoother and more intuitive.

## What's Next? ‚è≠Ô∏è

With just one day left (Monday 5/29), all that remains is testing, bug fixing, and releasing the game! It's been quite the journey creating this casual VR farming experience, and I hope you enjoyed following along. Stay tuned for the final product! And make sure to watch the [Itch.io page of the game](https://sorskoot.itch.io/life-at-pixel-farm) and try out the game soon.

Happy coding! üöÄ
