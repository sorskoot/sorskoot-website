For a while now I am streaming the building of a game with the working title _ZombieCastlePrincess_ on [Twitch](https://twich.tv/sorskoot). Although this game itself isn&#8217;t open source, I&#8217;ve put the editor scripts I build on [my GitHub](https://github.com/sorskoot/Sorskoot-Unity3D).

<!--more-->

These scripts are available:

**GroupInto,** works on a selection and places the whole selection into a new Empty GameObject.
  
**RandomizeSprites** lets you select a list of sprites and places them randomly on the GameObjects with SpriteRenderers you selected.
  
**RenameSelection** renames your selection and places a number behind them (like &#8220;Grass (2)&#8221;).
  
**ReplaceSprite** replaces the sprite on the selected GameObject with another you select.
  
**RoundOffColliders** rounds the points of a 2D PolygonCollider to the nearest integer.
  
**SelectBySprite** selects all GameObjects in a scene that have a certain sprite.
  
**SelectMissingSprites** selects all GameObjects that are missing their sprites.

I&#8217;m sure this list will grow eventually. If you want to see me use these and build my game check me out on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/sorskoot).
