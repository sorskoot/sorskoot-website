Creating an agent with Semantic Kernel involves several steps, including setting up your development environment, creating the necessary plugins, planning the agent's actions, and orchestrating these components to work together. Below I'll outline the high-level steps you would need to take to create an agent using the Semantic Kernel SDK based on the provided information.

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment
Before starting to develop an agent with Semantic Kernel, ensure that you have the appropriate development environment set up. This typically includes:
- Installing the necessary programming language SDK, such as .NET SDK for C# or the relevant Python or Java setup.
- Having the Semantic Kernel package installed.
- Optionally, setting up an IDE like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code or any other suitable for your programming language.

### Step 2: Defining Plugins
Plugins are the "skills" or "abilities" of your agent. They allow your agent to interact with the world by calling native code or external services.

1. Identify the actions that you want your agent to perform, such as sending emails or interacting with databases.
2. Write the plugins' code to implement these actions. In C#, you would mark methods with the `[KernelFunction]` attribute, which tells Semantic Kernel these methods are callable by the AI.

Example of a basic plugin in C#:
```csharp
public class LightPlugin
{
    [KernelFunction]
    [Description("Turns the light on or off.")]
    public void ChangeState(bool turnOn)
    {
        // Code to turn the light on or off
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Creating a Kernel
The kernel is the core component that orchestrates the interaction between AI models, services, and your plugins. 

For instance, here's how you might configure the kernel in C#:
```csharp
var kernel = new KernelBuilder()
    .UsePlugin<LightPlugin>()             // Load your plugins
    .UseOpenAIChatCompletion(apiKey)     // Setup AI completion service with your API key
    .Build();
```
This sets up a kernel with a plugin for managing a light and an AI service for processing natural language.

### Step 4: Building an Agent
An agent consists of planners and personas as well as plugins. The planners help define how the agent converts user input into actions, and the persona gives the agent a consistent personality or communication style.

1. Develop or select personas and planners that suit the agent's purpose.
2. Use the kernel to interact with these components, allowing it to process input and determine actions.

Example of interaction loop in C#:
```csharp
while (true)
{
    Console.Write("User > ");
    var input = Console.ReadLine();

    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(input)) break;

    var response = await kernel.ChatAsync(prompt =>
    {
        prompt.MaxTokens = 100;
        prompt.UserInput = input;
    });

    Console.WriteLine($"Agent > {response.Text}");
}
```

### Step 5: Testing and Iterating
Create a testing setup or test cases to validate your agent's behavior. Run through different scenarios and refine the plugins, planners, and kernel configurations to improve the agent's performance and versatility.

### Step 6: Deployment
Deploy your agent to the desired environment. This might involve setting it up on a server, integrating it with a web service, or distributing it as part of an application.

To create an agent for specific purposes, you may need to consider additional development aspects such as state management (memories), integration with other systems, and handling of edge cases for better user experience.

For a detailed implementation, refer to the documentation and examples that came bundled with Semantic Kernel, or check out the provided sample projects on GitHub for guidance.

To create an agent in Semantic Kernel, you would typically follow these broad steps:

1. **Develop Plugins**: Plugins are essentially wrappers around your existing code that allow Semantic Kernel to communicate with them. These could be snippets of code that can interact with databases, send emails, control IoT devices, or perform any other task.

2. **Set Up the Semantic Kernel**: This involves setting up the Kernel configuration with the necessary AI services and any other required services (like logging, telemetry, etc.), as well as registering your plugins with the Kernel.

3. **Create Interaction Logic**: This logic dictates how your agent interacts with users, how it processes user inputs, and how it uses plugins to respond to user queries or perform actions.

4. **Integrate AI Models**: Depending on what AI models or services you want to use (like OpenAI's models or Azure OpenAI), you will have to include them in your Kernel setup.

5. **Implement the Agent Persona**: This is the character or personality that your agent will embody. This could involve predefined responses, tone of communication, and response strategies.

To give you a basic idea of how you can start creating an agent in C#, here is a simplified version based on the provided information combined with standard practices:

```csharp
// Include necessary namespaces
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using SemanticKernel;

// Assume we have a class representing our plugin
public class LightPlugin
{
    [KernelFunction]
    [Description("Turns on the light.")]
    public void TurnOnLight()
    {
        // Logic to turn on the light
    }

    [KernelFunction]
    [Description("Turns off the light.")]
    public void TurnOffLight()
    {
        // Logic to turn off the light
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Set up the dependency injection container
        var services = new ServiceCollection();

        // Set up the Semantic Kernel with necessary services and your custom plugins
        services.AddSemanticKernel(kernel =>
        {
            // Assuming we have a method to add the AI service like AddAzureOpenAIChatCompletion
            kernel.AddAzureOpenAIChatCompletion("<Your Azure OpenAI Key>");

            // Add your custom plugin to the kernel
            kernel.AddPlugin<LightPlugin>();
        });

        // Build the service provider to resolve the kernel
        using var serviceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider();
        var kernel = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<Kernel>();

        // Interaction logic for your agent
        while (true)
        {
            Console.Write("User > ");
            string input = Console.ReadLine();

            // Process user input and interact with your kernel to get a response
            var response = kernel.ExecuteAsync(input).Result;

            // Output the agent's response
            Console.WriteLine($"Agent > {response}");
        }
    }
}
```

This is just a starting point. The interaction logic will typically be more complex, involving natural language processing to understand user commands, and more sophisticated handling of different conversation flows.

Remember that the above code is a simplified illustration. Actual implementation details, especially around the asynchronous handling and integrating specific AI services, depend on various factors, including the specific AI models you wish to use, the complexity of agent interactions, and other technical considerations. Additionally, you would need to implement the `KernelFunction` attributes and interaction details that fit your scenario.

Semantic Kernel's documentation and SDK should provide further examples and guides to go into more detail for various parts of this process.
