## Introduction: Games That Fade but Don’t Die

## What Is SKG, Really?

SKG (Stop Killing Games) is a consumer-driven movement against publishers intentionally disabling games after launch—especially those that require server access even for single-player experiences. Founded in response to games like "The Crew" being shut down with no alternative access, SKG advocates for game preservation, player respect, and transparency.

Highlight that SKG isn't about forcing developers to support games forever—it’s about fair access and avoiding deliberate deactivation.

Note that it’s mostly targeted at corporate decisions, not indie creators juggling server bills and technical shifts.

## How SKG Philosophy Applies to Web Games

Acknowledge that web games operate differently—many are free, ad-based, and inherently online.

Discuss how players may not expect eternal access, but still appreciate respect in how those games are supported or sunset.

Talk about WebXR/WebVR and how rapidly changing standards make long-term maintenance challenging.

Share examples from your experience: what happens when a tech spec disappears, and you’re left holding a game that no longer runs.

## Sunsetting Games Gracefully: A Developer's Dilemma

Address how sustaining servers and updating specs isn’t always financially feasible—especially for indie devs with limited income.

Offer practical, SKG-aligned strategies:

Provide downloadable or offline versions (if possible)

Post sunset notices or game retirement pages

Let players know what to expect and offer transparency

Reframe sunsetting as a thoughtful act rather than abandonment.

## Conclusion: Letting Go Without Killing

Reflect on your journey, your players, and the quiet legacy of each game.

Encourage readers—devs, players, and publishers—to think about games as experiences worth preserving, even when their active lives end.
