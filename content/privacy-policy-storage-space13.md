# Privacy Policy for Storage Space 13

_Last updated: December 9, 2025_

## Introduction

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect the information obtained through your use of our games ("Game(s)").

## Information We Collect

We collect the following types of information when you use Storage Space 13 or when you interact with Platform features (for example, when running on Meta/Quest):

- USER_PROFILE: basic profile information supplied by the platform such as display name, avatar/profile picture, and other profile metadata the platform provides to the app.
- USER_ID: platform- or device-provided identifiers used to link a player to their saved data and in-app purchases (for example, a Meta/Quest user ID or a game-specific account ID).
- IAP (In-App Purchase) data: purchase receipts, transaction IDs, order status and other purchase-related metadata necessary to fulfill purchases and provide customer support.
- Analytics data: non-identifying usage information collected via Google Analytics (gameplay duration, in-game interactions, device type, OS, and coarse geographic location).

## Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics to collect certain non-personal information about how users interact with our Game(s). This information helps us improve the performance and usability of our Game(s). The data collected may include:

- Game play duration
- In-game interactions
- Device information (such as device type, operating system, etc.)
- Geographical location (country/city)

Google Analytics data is used only for aggregate analytics and is not used to identify a specific user in our support workflows.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the data we collect for the following purposes:

- Provide and operate the Game(s): associate `USER_ID` and `USER_PROFILE` to save progress, enable multiplayer features, and present profile information in-game.
- Process purchases and refunds: use IAP data to validate and fulfill purchases, maintain transaction records, and handle billing disputes.
- Customer support: use profile, ID, and purchase information to investigate and resolve support tickets.
- Security and fraud prevention: detect and prevent abuse, cheating, and fraudulent transactions.
- Analytics and improvement: analyze aggregated usage patterns to improve gameplay, performance, and stability.

## Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect the data collected through Google Analytics. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

We store platform-provided identifiers and purchase metadata on secure servers only as long as necessary to provide service, to meet legal or accounting obligations, or to prevent abuse.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, by posting the new Privacy Policy on our website. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <privacy@timmykokke.com>

**How to request deletion of your data**

If you want us to delete the personal data we hold about you (for example `USER_PROFILE`, `USER_ID`, or purchase records where appropriate), you may request deletion by contacting us at <privacy@timmykokke.com>.

When you submit a deletion request, please include:

- The platform you used (for example: Meta/Quest)
- Your in-game display name and any known `USER_ID` or transaction IDs
- An email address we can use to follow up (if different from the account details)

We will verify the request to protect accounts from unauthorized deletions and will respond within 30 days with confirmation of the actions taken. After verification we will delete or anonymize personal data we control, except where retention is required by law or for legitimate business purposes (for example, keeping minimal purchase records for accounting and fraud prevention). We will also inform third-party platforms where feasible when deletion is requested and applicable.
