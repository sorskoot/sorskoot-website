In 2017 the JS13kGames competition added the VR category to promote WebVR. I've entered with this game. It's a turn-based game with influences from roguelike games. It has a generated dungeon where you need to find the pieces of your ship to escape the planet. You can read the full story of the game in [this blogpost](https://timmykokke.com/post/old/2017-09-15-js13kgames-post-mortem/).

### challenges

In this case, the biggest challenge was to keep all the graphics very small. This led me to create my own shaders to highly optimize the used images.
