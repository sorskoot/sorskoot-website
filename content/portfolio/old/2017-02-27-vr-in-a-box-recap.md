# VR in a Box

Last Wednessday, March 22th, I was given the opportunity to speak at an evening organized by the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Dutch-Mobile-NET-Developers-Group/events/236872259/" target="_blank">Dutch Mobile .NET meetup</a> and hosted my <a href="http://www.centric.eu/NL/Default/Staffing-Services/Software-professionals" target="_blank">Centric</a>. Since I&#8217;ve been playing with the Google Cardboard and Unity3D for a while this was a nice opportunity to tell people about it.

I started with a small introduction with a bit of my history with VR and I explained what Google Cardboard is and how it works in combination with Unity3D.

The second part of the presentation was about converting a physical cardboard box into a 3D model. I talked about the process from taking and editing photos to creating the model and baking the textures.

The last part was about a quick introduction to Â Unity3D, importing the model into Unity and showing it with dual cameras in Google VR. Eventually I wrote some code to walk around the model and how to handle in the event of the user gazing at a specific object in the scene.

These are the slides from the presentation. The demo will be available as a video soon.
