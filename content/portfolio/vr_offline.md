This year the WebVR category was changed in the JS13KGames competition. Instead of using A-Frame, BabylonJS had to be used. I've created a puzzle game, where you have to get the laser from the transmitter to the receiver by turning blocks. I've used some custom 3Dsmax scripts to create the levels and export them to json so they could be used as puzzles.

You can read all about it in this [recap](/post/2018-09-18-js13kgames-2018-postmortem/).
