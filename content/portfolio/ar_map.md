A demo to show a 3D map rendered on the table in AR. This demo was inspired by examples on the Hololens. I quickly found the Mapbox API and used that to render the elevation map using Three.js. I planned to add Web speech support as well but unfortunately, the WebAROnARCore browser didn't support this.
