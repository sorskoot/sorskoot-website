I was working with on a WebVR project the other day and was trying to get a model rendered with the correct textures. I was creating the textures in Substance Painter. I was doing a back and forth between various tools to get the textured model to render correctly. At first, I was using a .obj model. But I rather would have used a .glTF model.
Luckily, there's actually a very nice way to get directly to .glTF  from Substance Painter.

When you are done painting your textures, got to the file menu and look for _Export Texturesâ€¦_.
