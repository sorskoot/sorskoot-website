Whenever I have some spare time I get into coding on [my personal projects](https://github.com/sorskoot). A few years ago I started live coding, on LiveCoding.tv at the time. There were some people streaming programming on Twitch at the time, but only game devs and that was not what I was doing. I tried switching over to Twitch, but the lack of growth of the channel and lack of motivation from my side led me to stop. Earlier this year I decided to pick it up again. This time [only on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/sorskoot), where the community of Live Coders is growing fast. I felt welcome in the community . And I got affiliated pretty quickly, thanks to the support of the community. If you are looking for people coding on Twitch, you should have a look at the [LiveCoders team](https://www.twitch.tv/team/livecoders).

There's a lot going on when running a stream. In this post I'd like to give you a look backstage of what is going on during the streams.

Ofcourse there's a audio, video and a view of my screen. But there's more...

<!--  Intro -->

## Audio

In the beginning of my stream I used a cheap headset. The quality of the audio was very bad. The only benifit was that I could take it and stream from pretty much anywhere.
