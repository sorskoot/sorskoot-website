## Things we learned

`~~` is equal to `Math.truncate`. `Math.floor` might give unwanted responses when working with negative numbers.

Always think real hard about using `!`, `!!`, `&&` and `||`. This always goes wrong for some reason...

Times message from Rosie are better now. Might be improved a little bit. Not sure how.
