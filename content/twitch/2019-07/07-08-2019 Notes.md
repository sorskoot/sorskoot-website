Today we had a couple of items we wanted to get out of the way. We added a feature to be able to play the entire sample. We finished the refactoring of the transport buttons. And we fixed a couple of bugs.

## Things we learned

- You can use ' @ ' to refer to the root folder in Vue.js (webpack actually)
  - It turned out that this broke Storybook. To get it to work with storybook I added `config.resolve.alias['@'] = path.resolve(__dirname, '../src');` to the webpack config of storybook.
