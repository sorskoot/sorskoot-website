Today we started working on adding the first effect to the audio workstation. But before we dove into that we modified the design a bit and improved the sketch in Adobe XD. We added a slider control, added CSS styling for it and grouped that into a property editor. We wanted to add a retrigger effect. By the end of the stream, we had it almost working.
