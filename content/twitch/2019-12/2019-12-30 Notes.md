Today we are going to build a game in an hour (or so). Might doing some more prep and thinking of what to build. We need a mechanic and figure out how to build it upfront. I made a Yeoman Generator and some snippets to get started quickly.

Ideas:
 - Need a mechanic and theme
 - Lights Out ==> 7x7 Grid
 - Nonogram
 - Flappy Bird ==> Jolly Jelly
 - Hunt the Wumpus ==> map exploration

   Mechanic ==> Lights Out
   Themes: 

     - Beers, full or empty ==> Drink'em

     - Girls, dressed or naked ==> Strip'em
     - Sun and moon
     - cloudy and clear ==> A big sun, with 49 little clouds.
     - old and young
     - Sad and happy
