Tomorrow I will be speaking at the SDN event in Zeist. Today we are preparing the presentation and the demos. The presentation is going to be about Progressive web apps. We're creating an app that is being served from Azure storage as a static website, but it is using an Azure Function to store and retrieve  some data from a table in the Azure Storage. We are using web bluetooth to wirelessly communicate with an Arduino and blink some LEDs.
