Today I started working on my WebXR entry for this years [js13k games competition](https://js13kgames.com). I've decided to build a space invaders like game. Today we got the game up and running and made it spawn invaders that fly towards you.

## Things to Review & Notes

- what does `vr-mode-ui="enterVRButton:  Enter!"` do?
- nathnolt: have you ever played rez?
    [Rez](https://youtu.be/pgWv4OBUpjM) is definitely something to look at and has some similarities with the game we're building.
