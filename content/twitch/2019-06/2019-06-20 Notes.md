Sorskoot is working on the JavaScript DAW. We also need to get the transport in place to be able to play the segments of the wave files. Look [here](https://github.com/sorskoot/UltraviolentJunglist) if you want to see the whole codebase.

## Things we learned

- With [Storybook Knobs addon](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/knobs) you can add dynamic values to your story and see the changes reflect in there.
  
- Do not use `export default` when using an index.js in that folder. Use `export class` or `export const`.
