# Notes for stream 6-20-2019

Sorskoot is working on the pattern editor for the JavaScript DAW. We also need to get the transport in place to be able to play the segments of the wavefiles. Look [here](https://github.com/sorskoot/UltraviolentJunglist) if you want to see the whole codebase.

## Segments

| Timestamp | Topic             |
| ---       | ---               |
| 00:00     | Kick it off       |

## Things we learned

- With [Storybook Knobs addon](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/knobs) you can add dynamic values to your story and see the changes reflect in there.
  
- Do not use `export default` when using an index.js in that folder. Use `export class` or `export const`.
