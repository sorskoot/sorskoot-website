Today we started the stream with fixing a small bug with the volume in the audio player. Next, we started working on the track bar button to make it cycle colors and groups and we made sure it works in the track bar as well.

Then, we needed to add a similar thing to the waveform editor as well. This way we could select a group per segment. And play a randomized beat.

## Things to Review & Notes

- dare_devel_ops shared [amen.20k.org](https://www.gofundme.com/amenbrother2), a GoFundMe that raised money for _The Winstons_, who played the original Amen break. It's actually a sad story, read the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amen_break#Royalties) page and the [Original GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/amenbrother) if you want to learn more.
