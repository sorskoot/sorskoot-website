title: Building Rosie the Chatbot and the Overlays
tags:

During the stream, we worked on building a Twitch bot using Node JS. We tried to fix a bug with the Spotify integration and we worked on getting Rosie to chat about new followers by connecting to overlays app with Web Sockets. We ended with adding an overlay for emotes that explode when used in chat.
