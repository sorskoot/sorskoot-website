During the stream, we worked on building a score counter app.  It's going to be a Progressive web app, running on Azure Static Websites. The app makes a connection to an Arduino using the Web Bluetooth API and stores the data using Azure Functions. 

During the stream, we finished the app and made it ready for the demo. We got the Bluetooth working, and made sure the Service worker uses background sync. The app now stores the scores in an IndexedDb database, to sync in to Azure when the connection comes back.
