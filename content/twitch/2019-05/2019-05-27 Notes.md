title: Building Rosie the Chat bot
tags:
- javascript
- nodejs
---

During the stream, we worked on building a Twitch bot using Node JS.
We've added 2 new chat commands,!project and !theme. We've also updated the QnA that Rosie is using on Azure, so she gives better results.
I wanted to add a second Hue light to the control so the light effect come through better, so we added support for that. Than, we ended up in having a lot of fun with flashing lights and adding scary sound fx to it.
