Want to add some shaders to OBS:

- Grayscale
- Invert
- Colorize -> Make everything 1 color

{{< twitch eroketv >}} suggested a shader with the formula `abs(param - color.r),abs(param - color.g),abs(param - color.b)` for a crazy effect. It turned out this effect gave a very nice shade when providing with .5.
