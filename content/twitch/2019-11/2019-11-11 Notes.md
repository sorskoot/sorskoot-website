title: The rebuild of Rosie begins

The stream support tools start to grow out of control, 2 console apps and 3 browser windows and still more to be added. During the previous stream we decided we might need to rebuild it into an Electron app.

The idea is to build a pluggable architecture in Electron. The connection to Twitch and chat is built into the app, the rest is done using plugins. This way other people could start using the app as well and maybe build their own plugins to use on their streams.
