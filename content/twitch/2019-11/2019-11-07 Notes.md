For a while, I wanted to turn Rosie, our Chatbot, into a voice assistant. Today we worked on that. We used the Web Speech API to do speech recognition. We started to connect to [wit.ai](https://wit.ai) for the intents.

## Things to Review & Notes

- [21:45] +wingysam: `for (const module of fs.readdirSync('modules')) { const moduleExports = modules[moduleExports.name] = moduleExports.run }`

- [22:19] +wingysam: Btw VSCode understands JSDoc natively, just type /** above a function and it will spit out a jsdoc template with your function's params
